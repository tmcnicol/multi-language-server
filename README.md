# Multi langauge Webserver
The purpose of this project is to serve a restful API with a web server and then delegate the request to a second service which will be responsible for handling it.

The front end web server will be written with the go web server in the standard library.

The server handling the requests will be written in Node JS.

The communication between the two services will be done via GRPC.
